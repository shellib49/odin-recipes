        <h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
        <ul>
            15 lasagna noodles
            2 tablespoons olive oil
            1 cup chopped fresh mushrooms
            1 cup chopped onions 
            1 tablespoon minced garlic
            2 cups fresh spinach
            3 cups ricotta cheese
            ⅔ cup grated Romano cheese
            1 egg
            1 teaspoon salt
            1 teaspoon dried oregano
            1 teaspoon dried basil leaves
            ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
            3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
            3 cups tomato pasta sauce
            1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
        </ul>
        <h1>STEPS</h1>
        <ol>
            Step 1
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

            Step 2
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.

            Step 3
            Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, onions, and garlic and cook until onions are tender; drain excess liquid and cool.

            Step 4
            At the same time, bring a small pot of water to a boil; add spinach and simmer for 5 minutes. Drain and cool slightly; squeeze out any excess liquid and finely chop.

            Step 5
            Combine ricotta cheese, Romano cheese, egg, salt, oregano, basil, and pepper in a bowl. Add cooled mushroom mixture and spinach; beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 1 minute. 

            Step 6
            Lay 5 lasagna noodles in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread 1/3 of the ricotta-spinach mixture over noodles, then sprinkle with 1 cup mozzarella cheese and 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese. Spread 1 cup pasta sauce over top. Repeat layers two more times, then cover with aluminum foil.

            Step 7
            Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Cool 15 minutes before serving.
