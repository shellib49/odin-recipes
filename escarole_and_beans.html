            Step 1
            Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Toss in escarole, turning to coat with oil. Season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes, or until tender.

            Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; stir in garlic. Pour in beans with juice and simmer until creamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in escarole and parsley; simmer 10 minutes more.
